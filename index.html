        <p class="lead mb-4">About Me<br>My name is Nathan Wong and I am from Milpitas, California. Growing up I was born with a chronic illness known as sleep apnea. Before I had two surgeries to help me sleep better, I was sleep deprived and suffered academically and physically growing up. In fifth grade, I had two surgeries which helped change my life. I grew taller than most of my classmates and became one of the best athletes within a year of having those surgeries. After beating my chronic illness or suppressing its effects, I went on to play for three aau basketball teams, be a badminton champion, and be chosen to continue my study at University of California: Riverside. As a student at the University of Riverside, I am studying and working hard to graduate in four years or earlier.<br>
          <br></br>
        Hobbies and Activities<br>My hobbies and activities that I like to enjoy are: playing basketball, playing badminton, going hiking, cooking with friends and family, going to fellowship, learning about new history facts, and going kayaking. I have played basketball since 5th grade and I donâ€™t plan on stopping any time soon. My achievements in basketball are making it to three playoff tournaments and advancing at least once to the next round. I recently started playing badminton, but I was good enough to make it to the varsity badminton team for my high school during my senior year. During my time with the badminton team, I participated in two matches but I lost both of them. My varsity teamâ€™s record was sixteen to zero, meaning that we were undefeated. As a result of our huge success as a team, we became the division one league champions as well as the Coast Central Section champions. As for my other hobbies or activities that I enjoy, I try to use my excess free time on them. Hiking, cooking, and fellowship help me connect better with friends and family. I have hiked on forty different trails in my high school years and onwards. Cooking has helped me get closer to my mom and realize that I should put more love into my work. Fellowship has helped me connect with God and my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. Fellowship has helped me find peace and stabilize my physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional life.<br>
          <br></br>
        Goals and Aspirations<br>Since I am a freshman at the University of California: Riverside, many of my short term goals are geared towards helping me in Southern California. Short term goals that I have are: getting used to the environment at University of California: Riverside, joining the badminton club, developing good habits, getting Aâ€™s in my classes, and traveling with the badminton club. Long term goals that I have are: getting Aâ€™s in the future classes I take, visiting Big Sur, going on a mission trip, getting my drivers license, traveling back to Hong Kong, getting married, being a high school teacher, and living a more faithful life to God. I aspire to be a shining example to those with my chronic illness and be a good teacher making students better as a person, student, and citizen in this country.<br>
